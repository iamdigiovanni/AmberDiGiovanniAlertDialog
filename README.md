# AmberDiGiovanniAlertDialog

This is a very simple Android application created with Android Studio using a tutorial given as an assignment by professor in Spring 2019 Human Computer Interaction class
After clicking the button a dialog box appears that the user must interact with before exiting the pop up dialog. 
After choosing ok a toast appears back at the main activity telling which button was selected.
This was a great way of introducing alert dialogs so that they can be implemented in future applications.
